# WriteNote Legacy
A program, based on WinForm, to write notes!

This is a project that I am experimenting with for a long time.
The first idea for this program was written during 2016 and now in 2020 I rewrote it and it's way better!

1.3 Changelog:
And again in 2021 I have made it even better with fixing almost all bugs and adding new features such
as online cloud, writing directions, saving font selection and probably other things I can't remember now.

I have completely recoded WriteNote 1.2 so expect a bit better performance and different bugs.
